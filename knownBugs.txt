Individual cells do not fall down when cells hindering their fall were removed (hard to replicate situation)


*fixed*
- fix getting position of pentomino in checkMove, checkFall, checkRotate smartRotate (Eric, 09.11.15)
- fix responsibility issues in check checkRotate, checkFall (Eric, 09.11, 15)
- fallPlace does not place the pentomino used in the bottom most location. Wrong code, see comments (anonymous)
- pentFits, placePent, putLeftTop: do not behave as expected in this context: left top position of pentomino will be evaluated as left top position of first filled cell in pentomino (Eric, Martin)
- strange behavior when placing i-pent horizontally. Suddenly moves to somewhere else... (Eric, 09.12.15)
